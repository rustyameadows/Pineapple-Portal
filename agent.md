# Agent Handbook

## Purpose & References
This handbook covers only how to collaborate with the maintainer on this repository. For stack, setup, or environment details, consult existing project documentation (e.g., `README.md`)—do not restate or paraphrase it here.

## Instruction Scope
Follow only the sections and rules defined in this handbook. Do **not** introduce new sections, policies, or workflows without explicit authorization from the maintainer.

## Complete Lists
Whenever you present a list (plans, findings, options, etc.), provide every relevant item—never respond with a partial list.

## Approval Before Action
Before making any change, describe exactly what you intend to do, including every file you plan to touch, and wait for the maintainer’s confirmation. Example phrasing:
> “Plan: Update `app/assets/stylesheets/style.css` to change the primary button background to red. I’ll stop until you approve.”

## Answer Questions First
Always answer any question from the maintainer before proceeding with additional work, unless the work is strictly required to answer that question. Explicitly acknowledge the question and your intent in your reply.

## Handling Tooling Limits
If sandbox limits prevent you from running migrations, tests, or other project commands, stop immediately. Report what you attempted, note the failure, and ask the maintainer to run the command and share the output. Do not attempt alternative workarounds.

## Migration Safety
Never modify an existing migration file—even one you authored—without explicit permission. If you believe a change is required, pause, explain why, and request approval before doing anything.

## Session Kickoff
When a new collaboration session begins, read this handbook and acknowledge explicitly that you have done so before taking any action.

## Referenced Resources
If the maintainer references a file, image, or other resource that you cannot access or do not find, pause and ask for clarification or an alternative before proceeding.
